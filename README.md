# credit_card_transaction_analysis_SQL
# overview 

This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions using SQL queries. It provides a set of SQL scripts that enable users to extract valuable insights from transaction data stored in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). The analyses include calculating total spending, identifying top spending categories, determining the percentage of total spending by category, and exploring spending patterns over time. The goal is to help users understand their financial behaviors, optimize budgeting strategies, and support data-driven decision-making in finance and business operations.
